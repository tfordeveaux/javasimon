# History of project #

Project **started on August 4th, 2008**. The reason was that we were not satisfied with JaMON in terms of simplicity and monitor structure and so we created our own sort-of clone with some enhancements (nanoseconds, monitors in tree structure). Our **first release** was finished on **December 15th, 2008** and Java Simon contained first version of the core and **JDBC Proxy driver** in that time.

**Second version** was released on **June 19th, 2009** and brought **JMX support, Spring AOP integration** and also a little overhaul of the core API based on the feedback generated by the first version. Little additions and fixes followed during the subsequent 2.x releases with active periods alternating with some slower ones. Besides constant bug-fixing (thanks to our users) we added **Maven support** and basic **Java EE support** (Serlvet filter, EJB interceptor).

**Third version** dropped JDK 5 dependency (and JDBC3 proxy driver in favour of JDBC4 version) and came out on **October 11th, 2011**. We moved to **Maven Central** (group-id org.javasimon) and further improved Java EE support. Java EE and Spring is currently our main focus of improvement with embeddable web-console comming in version 3.2.
